    <h3 ><font color="darkgrey">Image compression gains prominence in picture archiving and communication systems for storage 
        and transmission of data. The advancements in technology enable the usage of computer assisted algorithms 
        for disease diagnosis and therapeutic planning. In this research work, a prediction based compression 
        algorithm was proposed to compress DICOM images. The local adaptive block based predictor compression 
        technique utilizes neighbourhood pixel gray values for prediction and the Huffman coder was employed for 
        the encoding of predicted coefficients. The compression results were considered effective, in contrast with 
        the 
        JPEG lossless, Kernel Least Mean Square, Context Adaptive Block-Based Prediction, and Least Mean square 
        Prediction approaches. The performance validation by metrics reveals the effectiveness of the proposed local 
        adaptive block prediction-based approach.  
        JPEG lossy image compression is a still image compression algorithm model that is currently widely 
        used in major network media. However, it is unsatisfactory in the quality of compressed images at low bit 
        rates. The objective of this paper is to improve the quality of compressed images and suppress blocking 
        artifacts by improving the JPEG image compression model at low bit rates. First, the image texture adaptive 
        non-uniform rectangular partition (ITANRP) algorithm is proposed which partitions the image into 8 × 8 size 
        image blocks with high texture complexity and 16 × 16 size image blocks with low texture complexity. Then, 
        a new transform coding based on the complete orthogonal U-system and all-phase digital filter (APDF) is 
        proposed for coding image blocks with different sizes. Next, a flexible adaptive quantization scheme is 
        designed to quantize image blocks with different sizes by considering the sensitivity of the human visual 
        system (HVS) to different texture complexities. Finally, combining the above method with the JPEG model, 
        a novel image compression algorithm model with low algorithm complexity is proposed to solve the problem 
        in JPEG. 
        The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our algorithm model outperforms the JPEG 
        image compression algorithms, the quality of the compressed image is greatly improved, and the blocking 
        artifacts are also significantly suppressed.

    <h1 class="one">CONCLUSION</h1>
    <h3><font color="darkgrey">Using prediction-based prediction algorithms, the current work presents algorithmic strategies 
        for reducing the size of medical DICOM images. Local adaptive block-based prediction outperforms 
        other approaches such as JPEG lossless, legendary polynomial-based image compression, 
        contextbased adaptive prediction, least square-based, and kernel least mean square-based prediction 
        techniques. The hardware implementation of the local adaptive block-based prediction technique using 
        Raspberry Pi B+ embedded processor makes it applicable for IoT-based telemedicine applications for 
        data transfer through the cloud network. The future work will focus on the compression of medical 
        videos for transfer through a cloud network. Security aspects will also be considered through a medical 
        image encryption algorithm. We propose a novel algorithm model (APUBT3-NUP) to compress the 
        still image. In our model, ITANRP is used to classify and partition image blocks according to the 
        texture complexity and obtain non-uniform image blocks. In the experimental part, the 
        feasibility and effectiveness of the ITANRP algorithm are demonstrated, and the better compression 
        performance of APUBT3 is verified by comparing with other transformations. The results show that 
        the compression performance of APUBT3 is better than other transforms in the case of low bit rate. 
        Extensive experiments and compression performance analysis show that our algorithm model can well 
        solve the problems of JPEG at low bit rate, which improves the quality of reconstructed images and 
        significantly suppresses blocking artifacts. At low bit rate, the compression performance of the 
        proposed algorithm model is similar to JPEG2000 and WebP, but because the proposed algorithm 
        model inherits the transform coding and entropy coding of JPEG, its advantage lies in its lower 
        algorithm complexity. In the future, we will focus on the fast algorithm and parallel computing 
        technology of APUBT3-NUP to optimize the algorithm execution time. In addition, since H.265/HECV 
        uses DCT as the transform core, we will further explore the performance changes of applying APUBT3 
        to H.265/HECV.<font></h3>
