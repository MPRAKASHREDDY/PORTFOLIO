    <h1 class="one">ABSTRACT</h1>
    <h3 class="two">      smart glasses are wearable smart glasses that add information alongside to what user sees.
        Alternatively, smart glasses are sometimes defined as wearable computer glasses that are
        able to change their optical properties at runtime. Smart sunglasses which are programmed
        to change tint by electronic means these are an Example of the latter type of smart glasses.
        Superimposing information onto a field of view is achieved through an optical headmounted display (OHMD) or embedded wireless glasses with transparent heads-up display
        (HUD) or augmented reality (AR) overlay. These systems have the capability to reflect
        projected digital images as well as allow the user to see through it or see better with it. While
        early models can perform basic tasks, such as serving as a frontend display for a remote
        system, as in the case of smart glasses utilizing cellular technology or Wi-Fi, modern smart
        glasses are effectively wearable computers which can run self-contained mobile apps.some are hands free and can communicate with the Internet via natural language voice
        commands, while others use touch buttons. Like other computers, smart glasses may collect
        information from internal or external sensors. It may control or retrieve data from other
        instruments or computers. It may support wireless technologies like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and
        GPS. A small number of models run a mobile operating system and function as portable
        media players to send audio and video files to the user via a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi headset.
        Some smart glasses models also feature full lifelogging and activity tracker capability.
        Smartglasses devices may also have features found on a smartphone Key Words: Wearable
        smart glass, Arduino based notification glass, Arduino based Bluetooth smart glass, Smart
        spectacles, Smart spectacles using Arduino. </h3></font>
    <h1 class="one">CONCLUSION</h1>
    <h3 class="two">    The system provides satisfactory results the system provides basic notifications to the
        display unit such as SMS, time, date and information about the sim card the phone is using
        in a continuous loop.
        • This system is placed in a 3d case which fits with any spectacles and can be used as a
        portable device. After which one is able to observe the date, time, cellular operator , the
        text message.
        • Google Glass is as futuristic a gadget we’ve seen in recent times. It’s limited in scope right
        now. The future, Google believes, is bright and the device itself is “incredibly compelling”.
        • Google is trying their hardest to push the Project Glass through the FCC this year. Reports
        show that Google is trying to get the approval by the FCC this year but there are already
        several hundred glasses made for testing internally.
        • Future scope of Google Glasses Google glasses are basically wearable computers that use
        the evolving familiar technologies that brings the sophistication and ease of communication
        and information access even for the physically challenged class of people those literally
        could not use general way of palmtops and mobile.</h3>
